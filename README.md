### I'm Andie.

#### I'm a quality engineer in Kansas City, MO. 

What I'm working on for fun:
- 🔭 [Cooking Yum](https://github.com/carsoncho/cooking-yum-calculator): a simple React app to calculate recipe stats for [Starfinder](https://paizo.com/starfinder), an RPG.
- 🐶 [What's That Dog](https://github.com/An-dy1/whats-that-dog): a kind-of clone of The Knot, but for hosting dog breed reveal parties.
- 🚴🏻‍♀️ [Bike crash twitter bot](https://github.com/An-dy1/pedestrian-and-bike-crashes): a fork of [Cailin Pitt's Twitter bot](https://github.com/cailinpitt/Pedestrian-and-bike-crashes) for tweeting information about pedestrian and bike crashes in Kansas City.

❤️ What I love (work):
- Learning: current topics of study include Angular, React, MongoDB and Express APIs. 
- Teaching: In 2022 I was lead instructor for an all-women coding bootcamp called [LaunchCode Women+](https://www.launchcode.org/). I taught Java, MySQL, object-relational mapping, writing unit tests, and more.
- Breaking people into tech: See above. I feel passionately about breaking down barriers to tech jobs and building a diverse tech workforce.

💙 What I love (play):
- Mountain biking: I've biked in six states and counting. Kansas City's mountain bike trails are no joke!
- Reading: especially mysteries, Regency romance, or anything medieval. 
- Anything French: one of my five year goals is to complete a French immersion program.
